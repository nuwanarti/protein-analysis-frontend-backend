Time (sec) to construct adj matrix:  0.00529 

 ----- Global parameters -----
Number of nodes (CA atoms): 162 
Calculated Node degree: 7.15 
Node degree from data base: 7.86 
Standard deviation from data base: 0.291 
Z-score: -2.4 

--- Count poor and long CA distances ---
Poor CA edges (total/percentage):  3 / 1.86 %
Long CA edges (total/percentage):  4 / 2.48 %

--- Poor subgraphs ( Number of nodes >= 4 ) ---
 Max. subgraph has  2  nodes.
 List of subgraphs:
! List of POOR subgraphs is empty !

--- Long subgraphs ( Number of nodes >= 4 ) ---
 Max. subgraph has  2  nodes.
 List of subgraphs:
! List of LONG subgraphs is empty !
