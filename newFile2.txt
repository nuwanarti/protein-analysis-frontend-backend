Time (sec) to construct adj matrix:  0.03516 

 ----- Global parameters -----
Number of nodes (CA atoms): 231 
Calculated Node degree: 8.05 
Node degree from data base: 7.99 
Standard deviation from data base: 0.309 
Z-score: 0.2 

--- Count poor and long CA distances ---
Poor CA edges (total/percentage):  9 / 3.91 %
Long CA edges (total/percentage):  6 / 2.61 %

--- Poor subgraphs ( Number of nodes >= 4 ) ---
 Max. subgraph has  3  nodes.
 List of subgraphs:
! List of POOR subgraphs is empty !

--- Long subgraphs ( Number of nodes >= 4 ) ---
 Max. subgraph has  3  nodes.
